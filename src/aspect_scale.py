aspect_scale.py - Scaling surfaces keeping their aspect ratio

This is a pretty simple and basic function that is a kind of
enhancement to pygame.transform.scale. It scales a surface
(using pygame.transform.scale) but keeps the surface's aspect
ratio intact. So you will not get distorted images after scaling.
A pretty basic functionality indeed but also a pretty useful one.

Usage:
is straightforward.. just create your surface and pass it as
first parameter. Then pass the width and height of the box to
which size your surface shall be scaled as a tuple in the second
parameter. The aspect_scale method will then return you the scaled
surface (which does not neccessarily have the size of the specified
box of course)

Dependency:
a pygame version supporting pygame.transform (pygame-1.1+)
